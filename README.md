# Today I Learn
The title speaks for itself. There are many great TIL repositories and this one is mine.

# How it works
The idea is I want a place to document every little thing I learnt everyday, mostly geek stuff, but could be anything. Then I want each document in `.md` format to be published to my github.io website.

# What to improve
- Ability to attach images or files in each documents.
- Ability to search by keywords in github.io.
